# Hacktoberfest Site

Code for the website that helps inform participants about the ACM Hacktoberfest event.

## Project Structure

This project uses [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), a React-based framework for generating sites. This allows for fast development with easy routing, as well as a happy path for SSR should this site become more interactive.

This project uses Tailwind CSS for most of its styles.

## Development

First install all of the necessary dependencies with `yarn`.

To start the local dev server, run `yarn dev`. By default, the site can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

Deployment details are yet to be determined.
